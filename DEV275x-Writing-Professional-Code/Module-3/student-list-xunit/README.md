# student-list-xunit

# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Unit Testing with XUnit to help ensure quality when making changes to the codebase. It is part of the [Writing Professional Code](https://www.edx.org/school/microsoft) course on edX. 

> The order in which you perform these updates is not important. We are trying to show a set of smells that can exist in a small codebase such as this one and how you can make things better. 


# Commits/ Tutorial Outline

You can check out any point of the tutorial using:

> git checkout update-?

To see the changes made between any two lessons use the git diff command:

> git diff update-?...update-?

### update-0 Initial Project
The project that is checked in is a **.NET Core** console app. To run the app, type the following at the command line. 

> `dotnet run -a`

You should then explore the code to see what other options are available, how the app is structured and what improvement can be.
