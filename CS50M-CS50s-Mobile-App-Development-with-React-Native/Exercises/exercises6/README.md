# Navigation
In lecture we introduced navigation concepts and the react-navigation library.

This exercise will walk though basic usage of the library, usage of route params, and demonstrate a common pitfall with nested navigators.

## Installation
This exercise was bootstrapped using the [Expo XDE](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/xde-tour.html).
To run it, open this directory as a project in the XDE.

## Exercise
For this exercise, there are a few buggy files located in [/bugs](./bugs). Replace
the import in [App.js](./App.js) with the buggy file to run it. Make sure not to
change the lines that the files say not to change.

## Solution
See the solution code in the [solutions directory](./solutions), or run them
without looking at the code to play with the functionality.
