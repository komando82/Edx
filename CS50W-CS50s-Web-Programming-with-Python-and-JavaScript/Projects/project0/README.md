# Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project0

Pages (HTML and CSS) on this Project0 only purpose is to meet Requirements posted on the [Project0](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/w/projects/0/project0.html) page. Pages, Content and Images inside this Project0  are dummy for this exercise. JavaScript included on each Page is only for displaying Mobile Navigation on Mobile Menu Icon click. Sass custom.scss file is compiled to custom.css file over command line sass command. 

The best way for me to describe all the work and functionality that is implemented on this project is by going through all Requirements.
